The enlightenment era following the Protestant Reformation brought forth a wealth of knowledge, art, ideas. It seems either I find myself within a period of enlightement or perhaps it is a worldwide shift. It seems like something is happening but I can only speak from my own personal experience. I find it interesting that the Catholic Church again finds itself in a type of reformation. fifty years after Pope John penned the encyclical of Vatican II we find our selves in the middle of things. it seems for me that pathways are opening up to the divine in ways we would have never imagined. With Public Mass suspended due to the virus it seems the faithful have been left to find their own ways to the intermingling of the human and the divine through their Spiritual Communions. 

There are many things offered on line, many resources to look to but nothing replaces the personal experience of a communion with the divine. it takes a tearing down of walls, it gently asks you to lay everything down of importance to you and allow a reordering.

There are many heros today we are seeing that we didnt recogognize in the days before the virus. First that comes to mind is my favorite checker at my local whole foods store. He just told me how awesome it feels to know how much the information he has acquired over the years of working there have been a source of empowerment for the customers he serves. There are many natural ways we can raise our immunity.

 I also saw it as I was on a walk the other day as a landscape company was embarking on a large job in the community. As I looked at him I saw the years of hard work by the sun acquired over the years. I saw his "uniform" was smudged with dirt and his hands mirrored the hard work he does with the earth to cultivate it. I also noticed by his ponch that he enjoyed a good beer at the end of the day and it showed in the rosiness of his cheeks. I congratulated him on being back at work and he happily remarked he has been busier than ever before. That he never thought he would be so needed and seen as essential.

In these days when education is held in such high esteem its good to recognize the workers who do the jobs we often think are beneath us. Neither my husband nor I had a traditional four year education, yet the pressure on our children and ourselves to attain that now even when sometimes the pursuit is clearly not one out of freedom but more of an expectation set. 

On the other side you have the child who expects it. has this caused childhood to be extended? I was watching the Sopranos last night and the daughter is going to a prestigious college and acts like she knows everything yet she hasn't worked a day in her life. While her dad is a mobster and her mom is the dutiful, Italian wife. Neither had a lick of college

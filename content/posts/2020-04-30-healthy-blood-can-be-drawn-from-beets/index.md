Anyone that knows me well knows that my husband is obsessed with juicing. Every month we juice an obscene amount of vegetables. We use an industrial size press juicer. This extracts all the fiber so that we can freeze the juice while preserving the nutrients. Fiber however is excellent for the gut so I have added it to bread recipes but mostly I end up leaving a trash bag of pulp out for my friend who and he feeds it to his pigs.  The other day we were juicing and I shot this photo.

 I attended the 2019 California Dental Association Convention in Anaheim. I have kind of had a love hate relationship with Continuing Education. When time is short, and it was as I raised my family, the last thing I wanted to do was sit in a dental conference listening to the same thing...blah blah blah. I admit to being inattentive at many of these. Just get this three hours over with so we can enjoy the lunch they are going to provide. It was all about clocking the hours so I could renew my Dental Hygiene licence every year. I was lucky to work very part time most of my career. This allowed me to put my focus on what mattered most  The speaker put up several photos of different vegetables. It was uncanny that once she pointed out the part of the body the vegetable resembled it was the part of the body that benefitted most. We see here in this beet, blood red in color and the circles mirroring our circulatory system. Healthy blood won’t pool and become sluggish. It will increase blood flow thus increasing overall immunity.
So eat beats, be well and be kind❤️
